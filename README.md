# LEGO Unity Microgame

Creating a game using the free [LEGO Microgame from Unity](https://store.unity.com/lego-microgame). Building this for the [2021 LEGO game challenge](https://ideas.lego.com/blogs/a4ae09b6-0d4c-4307-9da8-3ee9f3d368d6/post/d82d4bfe-12af-4498-a25d-12b118a6d718). The challenge ran from January 28, 2021 to March 15, 2021.

If you'd like to learn and use the LEGO Microgame for Unity, check out the [Unity Learn channel](https://learn.unity.com/project/lego-template).

The best tutorial to start with is [First Game Jam with LEGO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=pq_hjSUbrXs&feature=emb_rel_end&ab_channel=Unity) YouTube tutorial. This is a recording of their livestream tutorial and is run by the Unity team themselves.

LEGO Microgames are published on the [Unity Play platform](https://play.unity.com/). Go check out all the awesome LEGO games. [Get started with Unity](https://store.unity.com/lego-microgame?_ga=2.62865583.2020612240.1612847856-2003228940.1612847856) is where you'll need to go to submit your LEGO Microgame.

During this process, I also discovered [GitHub for Unity](https://unity.github.com/). Check it out today.
EDIT: apparently GitHub Unity is no longer in development as GitHub Deskop is widely available. Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and easily see your file changes, commit, push, and deploy your code.

## Custom LEGO Microgame

After you've done the tutorial, you'll be able to create your own Microgame.

[This what I created](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/webgl-builds-24967) you can play it now!

Inspired by the [NASA Mission Perseverance Rover landing](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/timeline/landing/entry-descent-landing/) on my birthday, we decided to create a Mars-themed LEGO microgame.

Explore the world of Mars, collect all the chests containing the tools to fix the rover, and make your way to the next level.

Don't forget, you're on Mars, so there's less gravity than on Earth. How will you explore this planet?

**To dos:**
- Build out environment more
- Change the stickers on the left hand objectives menu
- Package and deploy

#### Would love to do:

Import the [Mars Perseverance Rover model](https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/25042/mars-perseverance-rover-3d-model/) into the game. However this is copyright material and would need permission, and therefore against the terms and conditions of the LEGO Microgame contest.
